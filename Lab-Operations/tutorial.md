# Lab - Vault Operations

<walkthrough-tutorial-duration duration="40.0"></walkthrough-tutorial-duration>

## Description

* Task 1: Generate a root token
* Task 2: Rekeying Vault
* Task 3: Rotate the encryption key


## Init Lab


On first launch only

```bash
chmod +x ../install-cli.sh
../install-cli.sh
```

```bash
chmod +x ../vault.sh
../vault.sh
```

Reconnect to the lab

```bash
chmod +x ../vault-connect.sh
../vault-connect.sh
```


Restart from long sleep to the lab (not container or install)

```bash
chmod +x ../install-cli.sh
../install-cli.sh
```

```bash
chmod +x ../vault-restart.sh
../vault-restart.sh
```

```bash
export VAULT_ADDR='http://127.0.0.1:8200' 

vault secrets list -detailed
```

## Task 1: Generate a root token

Check command helper

```bash
vault operator generate-root -h
```

Generate OTP and save to otp.txt

```bash
vault operator generate-root -generate-otp > otp.txt
```

Generate a root token generation with this OTP and save result in nonce.txt

```bash
vault operator generate-root -init -otp=$(cat otp.txt) -format=json \
| jq -r ".nonce" > nonce.txt
```

> Nonce have to be distribued to all unseal key admins

```bash
vault operator generate-root -nonce=$(cat nonce.txt) $(grep 'Key 1:' ../vault-key.txt | awk '{print $NF}')
```

Decode the encoded token

```bash
vault operator generate-root -decode=DSUVFiR4FAISYhtiHDlZPwYqBh8/CiItCgseKw \
-otp=$(cat otp.txt)
```

Login with your new token

## Task 2: Rekeying Vault

During the initialization, the encryption keys and unseal keys were generated. This only happens once when the server is started against a new backend that has never been used with Vault before.
Under some circumstances, you may want to re-generate the master key and key shares. For examples:

- Someone joins or leaves the organization
- Security wants to change the number of shares or threshold of shares
- Compliance mandates the master key be rotated at a regular interval

```bash
vault operator rekey -init -key-shares=3 -key-threshold=2 \
-format=json | jq -r ".nonce" > nonce.txt
```

Because we have only one key

```bash
vault operator rekey -nonce=$(cat nonce.txt) $(grep 'Key 1:' ../vault-key.txt | awk '{print $NF}')
```

## Task 3: Rotate the encryption key

In Vault, rekeying and rotating are two separate operations. The process for generating a new master key and applying Shamir's algorithm is called "rekeying". The process for generating a new encryption key for
Vault to encrypt data at rest is called "rotating".

Unlike rekeying the Vault, rotating Vault's encryption key does not require a quorum of unseal keys. Anyone with the proper permissions in Vault can perform the encryption key rotation.
To trigger a key rotation, execute the following command:

```bash
vault operator rotate
```


## Clean Up (only at the end of the training)

```bash
chmod +x ../cleanup-install.sh
../cleanup-install.sh
```
