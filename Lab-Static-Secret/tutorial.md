## Task4 Manage the key/value secret engine using API

Vault help you to create curl command to access Vault through API

```bash
vault kv put -output-curl-string secret/apikey/google apikey="my-api-key"

```

> curl -X PUT -H "X-Vault-Token: $(vault print token)" -d '{"data":{"apikey":"my-api-key"},"options":{}}' http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/secret/data/apikey/google | jq


Generate a command to get secret path

```bash
vault kv get -output-curl-string secret/apikey/google
```

> curl -H "X-Vault-Token: $(vault print token)" http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/secret/data/apikey/google | jq

With jq you can extract a portion of response

> curl -H "X-Vault-Token: $(vault print token)" http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/secret/data/apikey/google | jq ".data.data.apikey"


Generate delete command

```bash
vault kv delete -output-curl-string secret/apikey/google
```

> curl -X DELETE -H "X-Vault-Token: $(vault print token)" \
> http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/secret/data/apikey/google

Visit UI to show your secret

## Task5 Explore web UI exclusive features
